description: An overview of the DYDX token and governance.
---

# Introduction

DYDX is a governance token that allows the dYdX community to truly govern the dYdX Layer 2 Protocol ("the protocol"). By enabling shared control of the protocol, DYDX allows traders, liquidity providers, and partners of dYdX to work collectively towards an enhanced Protocol.

DYDX enables a robust ecosystem around governance, rewards, and staking — each designed to drive future growth and decentralization of dYdX, resulting in a better experience for users.

Staking pools are designed to promote liquidity and safety on the Protocol. Rewards programs for trading, liquidity providing, and past usage of dYdX will help drive growth and adoption of dYdX.
