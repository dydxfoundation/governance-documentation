## **FAQ**

### **Can new DYDX tokens be minted?**

A maximum perpetual inflation rate of `2%` per year will increase the supply of DYDX beginning after five years after the initial token issuance, ensuring the community continues to have the resources to continue contributing to the Protocol.

dYdX governance can decide the maximum supply of new tokens that can be minted up to the maximum inflation rate of `2%` per year at each mint. Only one mint is possible in a given 365 day period. All newly issued tokens will be allocated to the Community Treasury and vest immediately. These newly issued tokens can then be sent to any address specified.
