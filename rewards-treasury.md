# Rewards Treasury

## Overview

In addition to the vested DYDX in the [Community Treasury](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/start-here/community-treasury), the dYdX community can also access the DYDX accruing in the [Rewards Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x639192d54431f8c816368d3fb4107bc168d0e871) each epoch as a result of the votes to (1) reduce trading rewards by 25% (958,904 DYDX) and (2) set the rewards for staking USDC to 0 (383,562 DYDX). Starting in Epoch 15, 1,342,466 DYDX  will accrue in the Rewards Treasury each epoch and can be used by the dYdX community with a [governance vote](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters).\
