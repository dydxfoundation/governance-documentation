# Trading Rewards

`25.00%` of the initial token supply (`250,000,000 DYDX`) was allocated to be distributed to users who trade on the dYdX Layer 2 Protocol based on fees paid. In [DIP 16](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/dip/blob/master/content/dips/DIP-16.md), the dYdX community [voted](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/8) in support of reducing trading rewards by 25%. As a result, trading rewards distributed in a given epoch were reduced from 3,835,616 DYDX to 2,876,712 DYDX in Epoch 15.

**Objectives**

* Incentivize all traders to use the dYdX Layer 2 Protocol.
* Accelerate market liquidity and overall product usage.

## **Overview**

DYDX will be distributed to traders based on fees paid on the dYdX Layer 2 Protocol. DYDX will be distributed on a 28-day epoch basis over five years and is not subject to any vesting or lockups. 2,876,712 DYDX will be distributed per epoch.

With the community voting to reduce trading rewards by 25% from 3,835,616 DYDX to 2,876,712 DYDX, the remaining 958,904 DYDX that accrues in the Rewards Treasury can be used/directed by the dYdX community with a [governance vote](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters).

In [DIP-13](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/dip/blob/master/content/dips/DIP-13.md), the dYdX Community voted to simplify the formula to be based on total fees paid by a trader in a given epoch.

## FAQ

### Who is eligible for trading rewards?

All traders on the dYdX Layer 2 protocol are eligible to receive DYDX as trading rewards.

The dYdX Layer 2 Protocol is not available to traders in the United States or Restricted Territories, as defined in dYdX Trading Inc.â€™s [Terms of Use](https://dydx.exchange/terms).

### How much DYDX did I earn in the Trading Rewards program?

In the current epoch, users can see fees paid and estimated trading rewards at [**trade.dydx.exchange/portfolio/rewards**](https://trade.dydx.exchange/portfolio/rewards) where users' trading data exists.

Rewards from past epochs can be viewed at [**dydx.community/history/rewards**](https://dydx.community/history/rewards)**.**

### How do I claim my Trading Rewards? When can I withdraw and transfer my earned DYDX?

Earned DYDX tokens via Trading Rewards will be transferable at the end of each epoch. DYDX token holders are required to wait approximately `7 days` (**Waiting Period**) after the end of the epoch to claim their tokens. Once tokens have been claimed, they can be used for dYdX governance.

Traders can claim their trading rewards at the end of every epoch, after the **Waiting Period**, [here](https://dydx.community/dashboard).

Users will need to click on "Claim", sign a transaction, and pay gas fees to claim DYDX.
