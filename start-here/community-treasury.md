# Treasury

`5.00%` of the initial token supply (`50,000,000 DYDX`) will be distributed to a community treasury to be allocated on an ongoing basis through contributor grants, community initiatives, liquidity mining, and other programs.

**Objectives**

* Fund programs and initiatives that drive the growth of dYdX.
* Develop grant programs to fund community NFTs, hackathons, analytics dashboards, memes, swag, third-party tools, translations, and other projects.
* Develop a best-in-class governance system and incentivize robust governance.

## Overview

The community treasury will retain DYDX to use as DYDX holders decide, whether it be for grants, new liquidity mining pools, or any other program. DYDX will vest to the community treasury on a continuous basis over the course of five years. A governance vote will be required to spend any DYDX from the community treasury.

If, after five years, governance decides to enact perpetual inflation (at a maximum annual inflation of `2%`), any newly minted DYDX will be available to the community treasury.

## FAQ

### Who can submit proposals to spend DYDX tokens from the Community Treasury?

Any user with sufficient proposing power can submit proposals. A governance vote will be required to spend any DYDX from the community treasury. To submit a proposal, please submit a dYdX Improvement Proposal (DIP) as laid out in the [DIP Proposal Lifecycle](../voting-and-governance/dip-proposal-lifecycle.md).

### What types of proposals can be submitted to the Community Treasury?

A community-managed treasury opens up a world of possibilities. We hope to see various experiments and initiatives, including ecosystem grants, which can foster the dYdX Layer 2 Protocolâ€™s ecosystem growth.
