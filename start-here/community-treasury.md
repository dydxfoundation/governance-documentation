# Community Treasury

**`24.2%`** (`241,735,862 $DYDX`) of the token supply is allocated to the community treasury for the dYdX community to use on an ongoing basis for contributor grants, community initiatives, liquidity mining, and other programs. Initially,`5.0%` of the token supply (`50,000,000 $DYDX`) was [allocated](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/start-here/dydx-allocations) to the community treasury, and 766,703 $DYDX vests in the community treasury each epoch. Currently, 3,787,251 $DYDX vest in the community treasury because several governance proposals resulted in a 3,020,548 $DYDX increase in the amount of $DYDX available to the dYdX community each epoch:

* [DIP 14](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/7) - set the rewards for staking USDC to 0 (383,562 $DYDX per epoch),&#x20;
* [DIP 16](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/8) - reduce trading rewards by 25% (958,904 $DYDX per epoch),&#x20;
* [DIP 17](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/9) - set the rewards for staking $DYDX to 0 (383,562 $DYDX per epoch),
* [DIP 20](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/11) - further reduce trading rewards by 45% (1,294,520 $DYDX per epoch), and
* [DIP 24](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/dip/blob/master/content/dips/DIP-24.md) - reduce Liquidity Provider Rewards by 50% (575,342 $DYDX per epoch).&#x20;



**Objectives**

* Fund programs and initiatives that drive the growth of dYdX.
* Develop grant programs to fund community NFTs, hackathons, analytics dashboards, memes, swag, third-party tools, translations, and other projects.
* Develop a best-in-class governance system and incentivize robust governance.

## Overview

The community treasury will retain $DYDX to use as $DYDX holders decide, whether it be for grants, new liquidity mining pools, or any other program. $DYDX will vest to the community treasury on a continuous basis over the course of five years. A governance vote will be required to spend any $DYDX from the community treasury.

If, after five years, governance decides to enact perpetual inflation (at a maximum annual inflation of `2%`), any newly minted $DYDX will be available to the community treasury.

## FAQ

### How does $DYDX vest in the Community Treasury?

Every second, the Community Treasury Vester (see details [here](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/resources/technical-overview#governance-architecture-overview)) vests [`0.3169242627`](tel:03169242627) $DYDX to the Community Treasury. Once $DYDX has been vested, calling the `claim` function on the Community Treasury Vester will transfer the vested $DYDX to the Community Treasury. Any dYdX community member can call the `claim` function on Etherscan [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x08a90Fe0741B7DeF03fB290cc7B273F1855767D8#writeContract) (which would require some ETH for gas fees) to move the vested $DYDX from the Community Treasury Vester to the Community Treasury.

### What is the vested balance of the Community Treasury?

dYdX community members can view the vested balance of the community treasury [here](https://dydx.shippooor.xyz/). \
\
Further, dYdX Foundation publishes the vested balance of the Community Treasury in the [Epoch Review](https://dydx.foundation/blog) at the end of each epoch. In addition to the vested $DYDX in the Community Treasury, the dYdX community can also access the $DYDX accruing in the Rewards Treasury as a result of the votes to:&#x20;

* [DIP 14](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/7) - set the rewards for staking USDC to 0 (383,562 $DYDX per epoch),&#x20;
* [DIP 16](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/8) - reduce trading rewards by 25% (958,904 $DYDX per epoch),&#x20;
* [DIP 17](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/9) - set the rewards for staking $DYDX to 0 (383,562 $DYDX per epoch),
* [DIP 20](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/11) - further reduce trading rewards by 45% (1,294,520 $DYDX per epoch), and
* [DIP 24](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/dip/blob/master/content/dips/DIP-24.md) - reduce Liquidity Provider Rewards by 50% (575,342 $DYDX per epoch).&#x20;

Starting in Epoch 26, 3,595,890 $DYDX will accrue in the Rewards Treasury each epoch and can be used by the dYdX community with a [governance vote](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters).

### Who can submit proposals to spend $DYDX from the Community Treasury?

Any user with sufficient proposing power can submit proposals. A governance vote will be required to spend any $DYDX from the community treasury. To submit a proposal, please submit a dYdX Improvement Proposal (DIP) as laid out in the [DIP Proposal Lifecycle](../voting-and-governance/dip-proposal-lifecycle.md).

### How do you go about building a proposal to spend funds from the Community Treasury?

Reverie has put together a comprehensive, technical, step-by-step guide on how any dYdX community member with more than 5M $DYDX ([proposal threshold](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-parameters#timelock-parameters) for a [short timelock vote](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/governance-process#short-timelock-executor)) of proposal power can create a proposal to transfer $DYDX from the Community Treasury to a destination address.

### What types of proposals can be submitted to the Community Treasury?

A community-managed treasury opens up a world of possibilities. We hope to see various experiments and initiatives, including ecosystem grants, which can foster the dYdX Layer 2 Protocolâ€™s ecosystem growth.
