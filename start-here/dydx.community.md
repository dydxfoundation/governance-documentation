### Governance

Active and past governance proposals can be viewed, and active governance proposals can be voted on.

Holders of DYDX and stkDYDX are granted two types of governance powers: proposing power and voting power. Via the dashboard, users may view their proposing and voting powers, and delegate them to other addresses.
