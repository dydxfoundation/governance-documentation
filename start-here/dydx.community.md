# üñ•Ô∏è Interface

The interface for governance, rewards, and staking is live at [**dydx.community**](https://dydx.community).

### Governance

Active and past governance proposals can be viewed, and active governance proposals can be voted on.

![Track proposal status and vote on changes](../.gitbook/assets/4.2-track-proposals.png)

Holders of $ethDYDX and $wethDYDX are granted two types of governance powers: proposing power and voting power. Via the dashboard, users may view their proposing and voting powers, and delegate them to other addresses.

### Staking

Currently, the Liquidity Module and Safety Module are inactive. Users holding $stkDYDX and $stkUSDC on Ethereum are not earning rewards. Users can `request to withdraw` and `withdraw` at [**dydx.community**](https://dydx.community).

### Trading Rewards

Users can view their previously earned rewards earned through trading activity on the layer 2 exchange.  In [DIP 29](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/16), the dYdX community voted to reduce Trading Rewards by ‚Öì from Epoch 30-32 on dYdX v3 to the following values:

* Epoch 30: 383,562 $ethDYDX
* Epoch 31: 191,781 $ethDYDX
* Epoch 32: 0 $ethDYDX

Currently, no rewards accrue for trading activity on dYdX v3.
