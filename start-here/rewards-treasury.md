# Rewards Treasury

## Overview

In addition to the vested $ethDYDX in the Community Treasury, the dYdX community can also access the $ethDYDX accruing in the Rewards Treasury as a result of the following votes:&#x20;

* [DIP 14](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/7) - set the rewards for staking USDC to 0 (383,562 $ethDYDX per epoch),&#x20;
* [DIP 16](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/8) - reduce trading rewards by 25% (958,904 $ethDYDX per epoch),&#x20;
* [DIP 17](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/9) - set the rewards for staking ethDYDX to 0 (383,562 $ethDYDX per epoch),
* [DIP 20](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/11) - further reduce trading rewards by 45% (1,294,520 $ethDYDX per epoch), and
* [DIP 24](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/dip/blob/master/content/dips/DIP-24.md) - reduce Liquidity Provider Rewards by 50% (575,342 $ethDYDX per epoch).&#x20;

On November 18, 2023, the dYdX community [voted](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/16) to bridge the ethDYDX balance accrued in the Rewards Treasury from Ethereum to dYdX Chain. Once bridged, the DYDX can be used by the dYdX community with a governance vote on dYdX Chain.&#x20;
