# Fee Discounts

Previously, users holding ethDYDX and/or stkDYDX received [discounts on trading fees](https://dydx.exchange/blog/v3-updated-fee-schedule) depending on the amount of ethDYDX and/or stkDYDX in a given user's wallet. On September 29, 2023, fee discounts were wound down and reverted back to normal fees for all dYdX traders. User's can see their current $DYDX holdings and fee tier [**here**](https://trade.dydx.exchange/portfolio/fees). More information is also available on the dYdX Trading Help Center available [**here**](https://help.dydx.exchange/en/articles/4798040-perpetual-trade-fees).
